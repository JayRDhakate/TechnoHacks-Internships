#Task 1: Perform Data Cleaning
Description: 
In this task, you are provided with the Titanic dataset, which includes three separate datasets: the training set, the test set, and a gender submission set. The goal is to prepare the data for analysis or modeling by performing two essential data-cleaning steps: removing missing values and handling outliers.

1. Removing Missing Values: This involves identifying and dealing with any cells in the dataset that do not contain valid information. Missing values can be problematic for analysis or modeling, so they need to be addressed. Common strategies include imputation (replacing missing values with estimated values) or removing rows or columns with missing values.
2. Handling Outliers: Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the data. They can introduce noise and bias into analyses or models. Handling outliers involves identifying and deciding how to address these extreme values. Options include transforming the data, capping or flooring the outliers, or excluding them from the analysis.

#Task 2: Visualization using Histogram
Description: 
In this task, you are provided with the Iris dataset, a widely used dataset in data science. The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal and petal lengths and widths for three different species of iris flowers. Your objective is to create a graphical representation that visually depicts the distribution of these measurements.

1. Dataset Overview: The Iris dataset provides valuable insights into the characteristics of different iris species based on their measurements. It includes attributes such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
2. Histogram or Bar Chart: A histogram or bar chart is a visual representation of the frequency distribution of a dataset. In this context, it will be used to showcase how the measurements are distributed across the different iris species.
3. Visualization Interpretation: The resulting histogram or bar chart will provide a clear view of the range and spread of sepal and petal measurements for each iris species. This visualization is crucial for understanding the variability and differences in the features of the iris flowers.

#Task 3: Remove Duplication
Description: 
In this task, you are provided with the Iris dataset, a commonly used dataset in data science. The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal and petal lengths and widths for three different species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Your objective is to identify and eliminate any duplicate records within the dataset.

1. Dataset Overview: The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset that provides measurements for different iris species. It includes attributes such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
2. Identifying Duplicate Records: Duplicate records are instances where all the attribute values across different features are identical. Identifying and handling duplicates is important to ensure data integrity and avoid skewing analysis results.
3. Removing Duplicates: Once identified, duplicate records can be removed from the dataset. This ensures that each unique data point is represented only once in the analysis.
